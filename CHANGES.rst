Changelog of lizard-progress
===================================================


0.1 (2012-02-10)
----------------

- Initial library skeleton created by nensskel.  [Remco Gerlich]

- A lot of stuff works; we can have multiple projects, multiple contractors,
  subareas, measurement types, we can schedule measurements and upload files
  that can be parsed. We can show layers and dashboard graphs and serve back the
  files, only to the right contractors or superusers. I'm marking this at 0.1 for
  no particular reason.
